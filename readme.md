# Minesweeper

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Minesweeper. It is written in TypeScript and uses React for the UI and Vite for bundling.
You can play it  by clicking [here](https://mines.pkozak.org/).

## About

This project was redone from scratch in React and Vite. This version is much cleaner and more modular. I also added a few features that were not in the original version like first-click safety.

I've returned to this project as I wanted to play minesweeper during boring lessons at school and want to make it a PWA, so I can play it offline.
**_(And it was ugly)_**

### Missing Features

-   Unsolvable board detection - There is a chance that the board will be unsolvable. I have not implemented a way to detect this yet.
-   ~~Sound effects~~
-   ~~PWA offline support~~
-   Animations?
